# LFS-Tannhauser

This is my second ever Linux From Scratch-build. It has the systemd-base and are really basic.

It took me appr 20 hours to make this system, and in the future I have plans to continue this project with BLFS.

---UPDATE---

I have now commited a tarball-file which include a dockerimage. Yeah that's right, you can try this out in almost all
it's full glory!

***You need to have Docker installed***

Run this command: docker run -rm -it "your docker_username"/lfs-tenhauser:latest /bin/bash

the -rm command erases the cachefiles so this won't litter your OS.
------------------------------------------------
Good luck!
